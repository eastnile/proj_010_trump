The CPS uses a complex stratified sampling scheme, and HWTFINL must be used to produce unbiased household-level statistics from IPUMS-CPS basic monthly samples. For analyses of March Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) data, researchers should use HWTSUPP. For individual-level analyses, researchers should use WTFINL, WTSUPP, or EARNWT. 

HWTFINL generally has the same value as WTFINL for the household head or reference person. Vacant housing units and households that could not be interviewed due to residents' absence or refusal to participate have a value of zero in HWTFINL; such sampled units were included in the public use CPS data beginning in 1988.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[CPSID is an IPUMS-CPS defined variable that uniquely identifies households across CPS samples. The first six digits of CPSID index the four-digit year and two-digit month that the household was first in the CPS. CPSID allows users to link a household record across samples, based on the 4-8-4 rotation pattern, by assigning a unique CPSID value based on a combination of household identifiers. CPSID will only ever appear for a maximum of 8 times, which is the number of times a household may be observed in the CPS survey (as indexed by MIS). In some cases, a household will appear fewer than 8 times due to migration, mortality, non-response, and recording errors. CPSID Extensive documentation about the creation of CPSID is available elsewhere [URL omitted from DDI.].

CPSID may also be used to link ASEC respondents who are in the March Basic Monthly file to other months of CPS data. This linking is made possible by IPUMS through the creation of MARBASECIDP. Users should note that ASEC oversample households (as indicated by ASECOVERH) will always have a CPSID value of 0.

Users may also want to see CPSIDP for more information about linking individuals across time using a person-specific version of CPSID.]]></txt>

      <labl>Annual Social and Economic Supplement Household weight</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[ASECWTH is a household-level weight that should be used to generate statistics about households in March Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) Supplement data. The CPS uses a complex stratified sampling scheme, and ASECWTH must be used to produce unbiased household-level statistics from the IPUMS-CPS ASEC data. For analyses of non-ASEC data, researchers should use HWTFINL. For individual-level analyses, researchers should use WTFINL,  ASECWT, or EARNWT. 

ASECWTH generally has the same value as WTSUPP for the household head or reference person. Vacant housing units and households that could not be interviewed due to residents' absence or refusal to participate have a value of zero in HWTSUPP; such sampled units were included in the public use CPS data beginning in 1988. 

Estimates on the entire population are prepared by projecting forward the resident population from the last available census. These projections are derived by updating the demographic census data from a number of other data sources that account for death, births and net migration. About 3 years after every census (i.e. 2003 for the 2000 Census and 2013 for the 2010 Census), the Census Bureau updates its independent population control and provides a new weight for the relevant years.

Two important points should be noted here. First, the lag between when the Census is conducted and when the CPS weights are updated is about 3 years. While the Census data are being processed, the CPS files are made available using the weighting scheme from the US Census prior to the latest Census. Second, once the files are updated, the old weights become obsolete and are replaced in the IPUMS data extract system. Published estimates from the lag years that use the old weights are not always updated. For example, 2010 poverty estimates were released in ASEC using the 2000 population controls. Once the 2010 population controls were made available, IPUMS-CPS replaced the ASEC 2010, 2011, and 2012 weights that are based on the 2000 population control with weights that are based on the 2010 population controls.

IPUMS-CPS makes available only the most up-to-date weights. The old values are available here: Old SPM and Weights Values [URL omitted from DDI.].]]></txt>

When analyzing ASEC data, researchers should use the person weight WTSUPP. For analyses including the variables EARNWEEK, HOURWAGE, PAIDHOUR, and UNION, researchers should use the EARNWT variable. 

WTFINL is the second stage weight in CPS (see technical documentation [URL omitted from DDI.]). It is based on the inverse probability of selection into the sample and adjustments for the following factors: failure to obtain an interview; sampling within large sample units; adjustments to the known distribution of the entire population according to stage, age, sex, race, and Hispanic ethnicity; and allotting a weight of zero to populations not sampled in other monthly surveys (i.e., persons in the Hispanic oversample and members of the armed forces in ASEC samples).]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[CPSIDP is an IPUMS-CPS defined variable that uniquely identifies individuals across CPS samples. The first six digits of CPSIDP index the four-digit year and two-digit month that the household was first in the CPS. CPSIDP allows users to link a respondent appearing with a designated household roster line number (LINENO) across samples, based on the 4-8-4 rotation pattern, by assigning a unique CPSIDP value to this line number. CPSIDP will only ever appear for a maximum of 8 times, which is the number of times a household may be observed in the CPS survey (as indexed by MISH). In some cases, individuals will appear fewer than 8 times due to migration, mortality, non-response, and recording errors. Extensive documentation about the creation of CPSIDP is available elsewhere [URL omitted from DDI.].

Users should note that it is important to verify CPSIDP linkages with AGE, SEX, and RACE. In some cases CPSIDP will result in erroneous links, which are due to errors in the source data. Cases with the same CPSIDP value may also have inconsistent responses across samples due to errors on the part of the respondent or in recording the response.  Ultimately, it is up to the individual researcher to determine the acceptability of the linkages made using CPSIDP. 

CPSIDP may also be used to link ASEC respondents who are in the March Basic Monthly file to other months of CPS data. This linking is made possible by IPUMS through the creation of MARBASECIDP. 

To get started using CPSIDP, users may want to sort their data file by CPSIDP and MISH to create a person-time file. 

Users should take care when including the March Basic or ASEC as part of their linking. Respondents who are part of the ASEC oversample (as indicated by ASECOVERP) have a CPSIDP value of 0.  For further information about the relationship between the March Basic and the ASEC, please see our additional documentation [URL omitted from DDI.].]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[ASECWT is a person-level weight that should be used in analyses of individual-level CPS supplement data. Since the CPS relies on a complex stratified sampling scheme, it is essential to use one of the provided weighting variables.

Researchers should use WTFINL rather than ASECWT when they wish to conduct person-level analyses of non-ASEC data. EARNWT should be used for any analysis including a small number of person-level variables (EARNWEEK, HOURWAGE, PAIDHOUR, and UNION). Researchers should use  ASECWTH for household-level analyses.

User Caution: For analyses that include the 2014 ASEC sample, please see the comparability tab.

The ASEC CPS files include two groups of people who are not included in the production of published labor force statistics: (1) members of the armed services, and (2) members of the Hispanic oversample who were interviewed in months other than March. WTFINL and EARNWT assign these groups a value of 0. Both groups are assigned non-zero values in ASECWT.

ASECWT is based on the inverse probability of selection into the sample and adjustments for the following factors: failure to obtain an interview; sampling within large sample units; the known distribution of the entire population according to age, sex, and race; over-sampling Hispanic persons; to give husbands and wives the same weight; and an additional step to provide consistency with labor force estimates from the basic survey. 

Estimates on the entire population are prepared by projecting forward the resident population from the last available census. These projections are derived by updating the demographic census data from a number of other data sources that account for death, births and net migration. About 3 years after every census (i.e. 2003 for the 2000 Census and 2013 for the 2010 Census), the Census Bureau updates its independent population control and provides a new weight for the relevant years.

CPS interviewers asked about income as a result of disability only if at least one member of the household had "a health condition or disability which prevents them from working or which limits the kind or amount of work they can do" or had "ever retired or left a job for health reasons."  If the answer was affirmative, the interviewer asked which household member (or members) had such a health condition and whether this person received income as a result of this health condition, disability, or handicap.

Income due to disability could come from the following sources: worker's compensation; company or union disability; federal government civil service disability; U.S. military retirement disability; state or local government employee disability; U.S. Railroad Retirement disability; accident or disability insurance; black lung miner's disability; or state temporary sickness payments.

For 1966-1967, the amount of dividend income was combined with all other sources of unearned income in the INCUNERN variable.

Of people who are coded as receiving dividend income in GOTDIVID in these samples, some (less than 20%) do not have unearned income in INCUNERN. Users should exercise caution when analyzing these cases.

For 1976-1987, the amount of income from dividends was combined with net rental income and income from royalties, estates, and trusts in the INCDRT variable.  If respondents did not receive income from rent and/or royalties during the previous calendar year (i.e., they have a code of 1 in GOTRENT), they did not receive income from estates and trusts during the previous calendar year (i.e., they have a code of 1 in GOTESTAT), and they did receive income from dividends during the previous calendar year (i.e., they have a code of 2 in GOTDIVID), then the dollar amount in INCDRT for 1976-1987 should indicate the amount of income specifically from dividends.

      <txt><![CDATA[GOTELSE indicates whether, during the previous calendar year, the respondent received income from "anything else" not covered by more specific income questions.  Earlier questions asked the receipt of income from the following sources:  wages and salaries (see INCWAGE); self-employment in a business (see INCBUS); own farm (see INCFARM); Social Security (see GOTSS); Railroad Retirement (see GOTRRRP); Supplemental Security Income (see INCSSI); welfare (see INCWELFR); interest (see INCINT); dividends (see GOTDIVID); rents and royalties (see GOTRENT); estates and trusts (see GOTESTAT); veterans' payments (see GOTVETPA); unemployment compensation (see GOTUNEMP); workmen's compensation (see GOTWKCOM); other government programs (see INCGOV); private pensions and annuities (see GOTPVTRP); military retirement (see GOTMILRP); federal government employee pensions (see GOTFEDRP); state and local government employee pensions (see GOTSTLRP); alimony and child support (see GOTALCH); and regular contributions from persons outside the household (see GOTREGCT).   For 1976-1987, the "anything else" in GOTELSE is thus a residual category for any sources of income not included in these other variables, such as income from hobbies, severance pay, and foster child payments.   

For 1976-1987, the specific amount of income from "anything else" is summed with income from child support and/or alimony and from regular contributions from persons outside the household, with the total reported as "income from all other sources" (see INCALOTH).  If respondents did not receive income from child support and/or alimony during the previous calendar year (i.e., they have a code of 1 in GOTALCH), they did not receive income from regular contributions during the previous calendar year (i.e., they have a code of 1 in GOTREGCT), and they did receive income from "anything else" during the previous calendar year (i.e., they have a code of 2 in GOTELSE), then the dollar amount in INCALOTH for 1976-1987 should indicate the amount of income specifically from "anything else."

      <labl>Received worker's compensation</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[GOTWKCOM indicates whether the respondent received income from worker's compensation during the previous calendar year.  For 1976-1979, the variable refers only to what was then termed "workmen's compensation," namely, payments by employers for the cost of injuries or occupational diseases received by employees in the course of their work.  Such payments cover medical care and physical (and sometimes vocational) rehabilitation of injured workers, and partially replace lost wages while employees are unable to work.  The level of benefits is set by state law, which varies significantly across states. Beginning in 1980, GOTWKCOM also denotes receipt of other payments (excluding sick pay and disability retirement) as a result of job-related injury or illness (see comparability discussion below).

For 1976-1987, dollar figures for income from the worker's compensation program were summed with income from other government programs (such as unemployment compensation, veterans' benefits, and disability payments from government programs other than Social Security) in the INCGOV variable.        
Prior to 1988, the amounts received from worker's compensation (or from other payments for job-related injuries) cannot be identified, but researchers can analyze the characteristics of the recipients of such income.]]></txt>

      <labl>Earnings from longest job</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[INCLONGJ reports the net amount (prior to deductions) that the respondent earned from the job held for the longest time during the preceding calendar year.  Whether such income derived from wages or salary or from self-employment in a business or farm is specified in SRCEARN.

Most income variables included in IPUMS-CPS report the total amount earned from a specific source (e.g., wages and salary) during the preceding calendar year.  INCLONGJ, by contrast, does not necessarily include income earned during the entire calendar year.  Imagine that an individual worked at one job for eight months, earning $10,000 in wages, and then worked for four months at two different jobs, earning an additional $5000 in wages.  Wages from the longest-held job (in this case, $10,000) would be reported in INCLONGJ.  Wage and salary income from the two jobs other than the longest-held job (in this case, $5,000) would be reported in OINCWAGE. Total earnings from wages for this person (in this case, $15,000, accrued in three different jobs) would be reported in INCWAGE.  If, however, a wage-earner worked at a single job during the preceding calendar year, the amounts reported in INCLONGJ and INCWAGE would be the same. 

Amounts are expressed as they were reported to the interviewer; users must adjust for inflation using Consumer Price Index [URL omitted from DDI.] adjustment factors.]]></txt>

      <labl>Source of unemployment income</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[For persons who reported receiving federal or state unemployment compensation, SRCUNEMP reports on the receipt of additional unemployment income from supplemental unemployment benefits and/or union unemployment or strike benefits during the previous calendar year.  

The term "supplemental unemployment benefits (SUB)" was not defined in the course of the ASEC CPS interview.  In other contexts, the words "supplemental unemployment benefits" may refer to either: 1) government income transfers extending additional weeks of coverage to persons whose regular unemployment compensation benefits have run out (e.g., under the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act in place from 1991 to 1994); or 2) to employer-provided payments that are written into private employment contracts and augment the amount (and not necessarily the length) of concurrent government unemployment insurance benefits.  While the use of the acronym SUB suggests the question was intended to refer to the second meaning, some respondents may instead have responded in terms of their receipt of extended unemployment benefits from the state or federal government.   

Respondents were first questioned about whether they had received any state or federal unemployment compensation during the previous year.  Only those who gave an affirmative answer to this question were further queried about whether they had received supplemental unemployment benefits, union unemployment benefits, or strike benefits.  Thus, all persons who reported this additional unemployment income (codes 1, 2, and 3 in SRCUNEMP) had also received state or federal unemployment compensation; however, only a fraction of those receiving state or federal unemployment compensation also received additional unemployment income from the sources covered by the SRCUNEMP variable.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[SSIKID identifies "children" (in this case, persons under age 18) who received Supplemental Security Income (SSI) during the previous calendar year.  These recipients may have received SSI payments themselves directly as beneficiaries, or the payments may have been made to a parent or guardian on behalf of the child beneficiary. 

While the ASEC CPS for these years generally defined "children" as persons under age 15, government programs such as SSI use the more common definition of "child" as persons under age 18 when defining eligibility for benefits.  Thus, some of the "children" identified in SSIKID as the beneficiaries of SSI would be defined as "adults" by other CPS variables, such as POPSTAT.  

Persons under age 18 may qualify for SSI on the basis of being blind, severely disabled, or for other reasons, such as living with an SSI-eligible parent (SSI Caretaker Supplement benefits).  Children with disabilities qualify for SSI payments only if the income and resources of the child and co-resident family members fall within eligibility limits.  By contrast, only the income and resources of the individual are evaluated when deciding whether an adult (age 18 and over) meets the financial limits for SSI.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[SSKID identifies "children" (in this case, persons under age 19) who received Social Security Income during the previous calendar year. These recipients may have received Social Security payments themselves directly as beneficiaries, or the payments may have been made to a parent or guardian on behalf of the child beneficiary.

While the ASEC CPS for these years generally defined "children" as persons under age 15, Social Security uses a broader definition of "child." Thus, for example, persons can qualify for benefits as "children" under Social Security's eligibility rules if they are unmarried and under age 18 or are unmarried, under age 19, and attending secondary school full-time. Thus, some of the "children" identified in SSKID as the beneficiaries of Social Security would be defined as "adults" by other CPS variables, such as POPSTAT.

To qualify for Social Security child's benefits, a child must have a parent who is disabled or retired and entitled to Social Security benefits or a parent who died after having worked long enough in a job where he or she paid Social Security taxes.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[VETQA indicates whether respondents who received veterans' payments during the previous calendar year said that they were required to fill out an annual income questionnaire for the Veterans Administration for VA compensation and pension purposes.

Note:  Many veterans must also supply income information to determine their eligibility for enrollment into the VA health care system.  While many veterans qualify for cost-free health care services based on a compensable service-related condition or other qualifying factor (e.g., former prisoners of war, Purple Heart recipients), most veterans are required to complete an annual financial assessment or means test to determine if they qualify for cost-free services.  Veterans whose household income and net worth exceed the established threshold, as well as those who choose not to complete the financial assessment, must agree to pay required co-payments to become eligible for VA health care services.]]></txt>

      <labl>First reason for receiving social security income</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[WHYSS1 reports the first reason respondents gave for receiving Social Security payments during the previous calendar year.  If persons received Social Security payments for more than one reason (e.g., on the basis of both widowhood and disability), they reported their second reason for receiving Social Security payments in the complementary variable WHYSS2.

Respondents were to report Social Security payments that they themselves received as beneficiaries and Social Security payments that they received on behalf of a child beneficiary.  When interpreting the value labels, users should keep in mind the two meanings of "child" in this context.  Beginning in 1980, the ASEC CPS defined as a "child" anyone under age 15; persons age 15 and older were considered "adults" by the survey and were asked questions about their employment and own income.  (Prior to 1980, persons under age 14 were considered "children" in terms of the survey universe for work and income questions.)  By contrast, government programs such as Social Security generally use the more common definition of "child" to mean persons under age 18 when defining eligibility for benefits.  Thus, the value label "Surviving child" (corresponding to code 5) covers reporting of one's own benefits by persons who qualify for benefits as "children" under Social Security's eligibility rules (i.e., they are unmarried and under age 18 or are unmarried, under age 19, and attending secondary school full-time) but who are "adults" in terms of the CPS definition (i.e., they have passed their 15th birthday).    The value label "On behalf of surviving, dependent, or disabled child(ren)" (corresponding to code 7) covers reporting of benefits on behalf of persons who are under age 15.]]></txt>
